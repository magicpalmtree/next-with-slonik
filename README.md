## Setup

You'll need PostgreSQL for this.

### PostgreSQL Installation instructions

#### Windows

**Pre-requisite:** Git bash or other similar Bash shell.

Install PostgreSQL with [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/):

**Note:** The following command should be run in **an administrative prompt** (right-click on Hyper or whatever Terminal you use and click on "Run as Administrator").

```sh
choco install postgresql --version=11.5 -y
```

This will install PostgreSQL and create a default user of `postgres`.

**Important:** Pay attention during the installation - it will display the password for the `postgres` user on a yellow line starting with the word `WARNING`. Save this password for later. It will look like this:

Now let's set an environment variable to tell PostgreSQL where to find the programs and where to put the data:

```sh
cd /c/
POSTGRES_PATH=$(find . -name "psql.exe" -print -quit)
POSTGRES_BIN_PATH=$(dirname "${POSTGRES_PATH/./\/c}")
echo "export PATH=\$PATH:\"$POSTGRES_BIN_PATH\"" >> $USERPROFILE/.bash_profile
echo "export PGDATA=\"${POSTGRES_BIN_PATH/bin/data}\"" >> $USERPROFILE/.bash_profile
source $USERPROFILE/.bash_profile
```

Now everything should be ready to go! Try running `postgres` on the command line.

If this works, then we can continue setting up the user, by changing the password for the `postgres` user.

When you run this next command, it will ask you for a password. Use the password that you saved from the installation earlier:

```sh
psql -U postgres -c "ALTER ROLE postgres PASSWORD 'postgres';"
```

Run the following commands to set up the database and the user (now the password will be `postgres`):

```sh
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE slonik;"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER slonik WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'slonik';"
psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE slonik TO slonik;"
```

#### macOS

Install PostgreSQL with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

This will install PostgreSQL and create just a single user with your username and all role permissions. There will be no `postgres` user set up.

Now let's set an environment variable to tell PostgreSQL where to put the data:

```sh
echo "export PGDATA=/usr/local/var/postgres" >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now everything should be ready to go! Try running `postgres` on the command line.

Run the following commands to set up the database and the user:

```sh
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE slonik;"
psql postgres -c "CREATE USER slonik WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'slonik';"
psql postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE slonik TO slonik;"
```

### Run Migrations to Set up Tables

The migrations that have been written using [@slonik/migrator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slonik/migrator) can be run using the following command:

```sh
node migrate up
```

To roll back the changes in the migrations, run the following command:

```sh
node migrate down
```

### Create New Migrations

The [@slonik/migrator](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@slonik/migrator) tool can be used to create new migrations as well.

For example, to create a new migration called `todo` (for example, to create a database table called `todo`):

```sh
node migrate create todo
```
